# Exoplanet Discovery
👋 Hello! Welcome to the Exoplanet Discovery Repo.

This repo is divided into two phases, but I suggest you look into Phase 2.
Phase 2 involves the actual prediction on both multi-linear regression and deep
neural network models. There is also a fair bit of litearture justifying the model
training, results and parameters.

## 🔬 Aim
Predict the likelihood of an exoplanet existing depending on the properties of the star and solar system the planet
is in.

## 😁 Significance
Discovering an exoplanet is a long and tedious task. While other techniques exist, most often planets are discovered
when they pass their Sun, causing a noticeable dip in starlight. This process can involve expensive space equipment
observing the sun for long periods of time and has a reasonable chance of failling to spot a new exoplanet planet.

By predicting the likelihood of an exoplanet existing in a given system, we would be able to focus on star
systems that has a higher chance of carrying an undiscovered planet, which should result in the discovery of more exoplanets in our 
universe!
